"""
Loads California Housing and Community Development's dataset of housing
permits by place from 2018-2022.

This is probably more accurate than BPS. In particular, most cities don't
seem to be reporting ADUs to the Census, but they do to HCD.

Because of SB 35 triggers based on the amount of housing permitted, cities have
a greater incentive to report this data correctly.
